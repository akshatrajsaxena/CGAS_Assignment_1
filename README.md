# Web Scraping (BeautifulSoup)
 
 **This projects deals with the scraped data from food websites and use that data to plot relevant graphs.** Some important distributions includes frequency-rank distributions, recipe size distributions 

## Why I Use BeautifulSoup or Jupyter Notebook

I use BeautifulSoup for web scraping because it provides a powerful yet simple interface to navigate and extract data from HTML and XML documents. Its flexibility allows to efficiently parse complex web pages, extract relevant information like text, links, and images, and convert them into structured formats. Jupyter Notebook complements this by offering an interactive environment where I can write and execute code in real time, visualize data instantly, and document my thought process. This combination makes it easier to experiment, debug, and refine scraping scripts quickly, while also providing a platform for sharing and presenting results effectively.

Main Components

```
.ipynb files: These jupyter files contained the code for problem statement.
.csv and .txt file: The output of the data extractions are stored in this files.

```
